# Transaction-fraud-detection-
This repository explores transaction fraud detection using two popular machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression and Decision Tree. It provides a practical starting point for building fraud detection models that can analyze transaction data and identify potentially fraudulent activities.
Scripts for data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model training/evaluation for both linear regression and decision tree approaches.
Sample data (simulated or anonymized) to demonstrate the functionalities.
Documentation explaining the models, their strengths/weaknesses, and the overall workflow.
Benefits:

Gain hands-on experience with machine learning for fraud detection.
Understand the fundamentals of linear regression and decision tree algorithms.
Learn how to prepare transaction data for model training.
Explore basic model evaluation techniques.
